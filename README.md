# 🖐️ Smart Home Control with Hand Gestures

This project is an application that aims to control smart home devices by recognizing hand gestures. It allows users to control devices like TVs, lights, and other appliances using their hand movements.

## 📌 Project Overview

This application is developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It uses deep learning models to recognize hand gestures and control devices (e.g., stop, turn on, turn off) based on specific gestures.

## 📂 Dataset Used

The hand gesture data used in this project comes from the **LeapGestRecog** Kaggle dataset:
🔗 [LeapGestRecog (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog?resource=download)

This dataset contains over 200,000 images of 10 basic gestures from different hands. It has been used for training and testing gesture recognition models.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* TensorFlow (or another ML library)
* Tkinter (for graphical interface)

## 🚀 Installation and Running

1️⃣ Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MertCanBrl/Smart-Home-Control-with-Hand-Gestures.git
cd Smart-Home-Control-with-Hand-Gestures
```
